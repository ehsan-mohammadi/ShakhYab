Sometimes, you may follow someone on Instagram, but he doesn't follow you back. Or might he follow you back and after that, he unfollow you. In Iran, we call these people "شاخ" (Say: Shakh)!

Absolutely, it's hard and boring to looking for these people by comparing follower and following list.

Shakh Yab is a simple, free and open-source Instagram manager tool that find out users who don't follow you back on Instagram. With Shakh Yab you can easily find a list of all users who do not follow your account on Instagram but whom you follow. So, if you are asking yourself "Who unfollowed me on Instagram?", just start using Shakh Yab to find out who unfollowed you.

**NOTE:** This project is under development, so the README completed soon.
